# friendGen
Don't have any friends? We got you. friendGen is an application that takes in a photo of you and adds a friend to it using generative AI. This way, at least your social media will think you're popular ;)
<br>
<br>
Built on AWS cloud9, we used Titan Image Generatorâ€™s image mask inpainting capability for the AI friend insertion and Streamlit for the UI. This was our project submission for UBC CIC Hackathon 2024, meaning it was built in 9 hours!
